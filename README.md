## About

This little text adventure game starts as a small exercise for OOP.
It became a lot more extensive as my Kids liked to play a Knight and 
fighting some creatures. They had a lot ideas for wappons, armor and creatures and was exited when that project grows and they tested it alot. :D
Note: This game is in german.

So in this little game you have to save your town from evil monsters. Therefor you have to clean four regions by defeating their bosses. You can train yourself at a tournament place, by better equipment at the marketplace and sometimes there will be loot from your enemies.
